These are quick notes Aric has said about the final project / demo

- (Demo) The demo is just a progress check to what we have been working on. The entire
code doesn't have to work however it has to do SOMETHING. The parts we don't have
working, we just say our plan about what its supposed to do.

- We all present a piece of the demo and final project. The demo AND final presentation
should be about 5 minutes.

- (Final Presentation Specific)
Elevator pitch. A brief overview of our code. Why we choose it, what it generally
does. We don't have to review every single line of the code. Just what we think
would be interesting towards the class. 

- (Final Presentation Specific)
We all have to present. (Basically our parts of the code)

- (Final Project Specific)
We need to have a seperate pdf or markdown file "README" that explains parts
of the code that isnt obvious. (How to run the code, what arguments it takes, etc).

- (Final Project Specific)
We need to have a file to take "credit" about certain techniques we have in the 
final code. For example (F-Strings : Kevin Pham).  We all can use f-strings but 
just someone has to claim credit for it in our code. There is a list of techniques
he wants us to use in our code.
